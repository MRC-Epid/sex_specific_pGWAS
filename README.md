Code repository for Koprulu et al. 2025 "Sex differences in the genetic regulation of the human plasma proteome".

The code and scripts in this repository describes the core analysis done in the paper and can easily derived from any of the scripts. All analyses were conducted using publicly available methods, as detailed in the Methods section of the study manuscript. Please keep in mind that this code has been written to run on the HPC system of the University of Cambridge and requires dedicated input files, which are not always sharable due to privacy reasons, e.g., individual level genotypes. While the authors are happy to answer questions, there will be no active maintenance of the code stored.
